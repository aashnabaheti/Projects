The dataset given represents the performance of weighted scoring stock portfolios obtained through mixture design from the US stock market historical database. The entities in the dataset are evaluated based on a set of financial metrics or characteristics, and the weights assigned to these metrics contribute to the overall scoring of each stock portfolio. The input variables include factors like Book-to-Price Ratio, Return on Equity, Sales-to-Price Ratio, Return Rates, Market Value and Systematic Risk. The output metrics include Annual Return, Excess Return, Systematic Risk, Total Risk, Absolute Win Rate and Relative Win Rate.

The main objective of this project is to build a predictive model to provide insights into how different factors or metrics influence the ideal mix of investments.
